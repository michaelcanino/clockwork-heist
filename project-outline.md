# The Clockwork Heist – Project Outline

## Phase 1 – Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Core Classes**: CrewMember, Tool, Heist, Location, Event, Player.
- **Gameplay Loop**: recruit crew → select target → assign roles/tools → resolve with dice/stat checks.
- **Content Scope**: 2–3 crew types, 2 tools, 1–2 locations (manor, vault).
- **Outcomes**: loot gained, notoriety changes, crew status (healthy/injured).

---

## Phase 2 – Replayability & QoL
- Expand crew roster with unique traits (e.g., gambler, alchemist).
- Add multiple heist locations with varying difficulty and rewards.
- More tools (runes, gadgets, explosives).
- Introduce random events (guards, traps, rival thieves).
- Basic save/load system for persistence.

---

## Phase 3 – Strategic Depth
- **Notoriety system**: affects encounters and difficulty.
- **Crew progression**: XP system, skill increases.
- **Reputation system**: feared vs respected.
- **More complex outcomes**: partial success, betrayal, arrest.

---

## Phase 4 – Factions & Narrative
- Introduce factions (Guilds, Nobles, Syndicates).
- Branching narrative choices: ally, betray, oppose factions.
- Between-heist story events.
- Simple campaign arcs (multi-heist storylines with stakes).

---

## Phase 5 – Emergent Systems
- Rival AI crews competing for targets.
- Procedural generation of heist locations, loot, events.
- Dynamic city map with hotspots and risk levels.
- City-wide power shifts based on player choices.

---

## Phase 6 – Advanced Features (Stretch Goals)
- Multi-heist campaigns with cumulative consequences.
- Deeper crew management (loyalty, morale, recruitment stories).
- Heat system with escalating law enforcement pressure.
- Airship heists, clockwork engines, larger worldbuilding.

---

## Impractical or Impossible in a Text-Based Game
- **Real-time stealth mechanics** (sneaking or timing-based play).
- **3D spatial navigation** (moving in detailed physical environments).
- **Graphical puzzles/minigames** (lockpicking simulations, wiring puzzles).
- **Cinematic visuals** beyond ASCII art/static text.
- **Large-scale multiplayer** (possible, but unrealistic for a solo hobby dev).
