# The Clockwork Heist

## Basic Lore

In the heart of **Brasshaven**, colossal aether-engines pump steam and magic through towering factories, sprawling airship docks, and the gilded halls of nobles. The city thrives on invention, but beneath the hiss of pistons and the hum of gears lies a ruthless struggle for power.

The **Guilds** guard their patents and secrets. The **Noble Houses** flaunt wealth stolen from generations past. And the **Rogue Syndicates** — daring crews of thieves, artificers, and mages — scheme in the shadows, striking at the city’s vaults and reliquaries.

You are a **crew leader**, a tactician in this underworld of brass and smoke. Your crew lives by wit, steel, and spell, planning audacious heists to steal forbidden artifacts, sabotage rivals, and tilt the balance of power. Each job carries risk — guards with clockwork rifles, traps woven with ancient runes, or rival crews eager to cut you down.

Brasshaven remembers its thieves. Rise, and your name will echo in whispers through the alleys. Fail, and your bones will be left in the gutters, another lesson in the city’s unforgiving clockwork rhythm.
